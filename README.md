#Im Going to be updating this readme tmmr, just wanna get everything uploaded

#Main gist, can take from about 126 different browsers, 99 being chromium based, 26 being gecko (firefox) based. it can also take from like over 50 crypto extension, and like 20 different password manager extensions, ill get an exact number later. It can steal browsers cookies and other files without closing the browsers which appears to be new or not done too often, you can read the code to figure out how (FileLockBypasser.cs). It uses heavens gate (run 64bit code from a 32bit process) in order to extract 64bit and 32bit firefox passwords (make sure you compile it as x86). It takes from a bunch of applications too. Ill get this repo sorted out soon.
